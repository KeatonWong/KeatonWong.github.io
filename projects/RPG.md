The assignment was to make an RPG where a user could create their character by choosing a class (Assassin, Mage, Tank, etc.) and inputting their name. Each character had health, attack, defense, and speed stats, and operated similarly to Pok√©mon, where the user could choose to run from an enemy or attack them. There are multiple bosses and a leveling system - after you defeat an enemy, you level up and gain stat boosts. This was a very big project and we learned how to give a user multiple options and be creative.
