The assignment was to make the game with the same rules as the actual game, played by two players that inputted the column they wanted to put their piece in. I made a computer player for fun. It makes the "best move" at the time but doesn't account for multiple moves ahead (like in chess), and it can be predictable at times, but is still a decently strong opponent.
