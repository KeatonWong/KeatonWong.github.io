In classrooms, nowadays teachers often encourage their students to ask questions, generally because "another student might have the same question." However, they almost never teach how to ask questions better. Somehow, like listening, question-asking seems to be an underacknowledged skill. Asking questions better results in not only more answers in general, but more complete answers, and answers that are more specific to your question. If one were to simply ask, "why does my code not work?", an answerer would need to find out the objective of the program, the intent of the programmer, and a solution that is similar to the programmer's code, so that they actually understand the answer. This does not include the fact that there are often multiple solutions to a problem in the coding world, that each have their strengths and weaknesses. Explaining all of this to someone who may simply just be looking for a solution so that they can get their homework done and go do other things is probably not worth it to most people. Let's take a look at a couple of examples.

This post at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70137276/circular-object-object-in-for-loop-javascript">StackOverflow</a> by user ChrisYates shows some good signs of smart question-asking on Stack Overflow. His subject is simple, and tells us the thing that is puzzling him - a "circular object Object". He then says what he is trying to get to output, which is also what he expects his code to output (an array of two objects), shows his code, and also shows what his code actually outputs (an array with one object and one circular object Object). He also states that he is new to the language and has tried to look at other examples, which makes people more likely to respond to him. His question could be better, such as making his title more accurate (the circular object Object is in his array output, not a for loop) or explaining what his code does at each step, but it is a good start.

This post at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3709179/need-help-with-java-homework">StackOverflow</a> by user Jon is an example of a question that is asked poorly. Firstly, the subject isn't useful or relevant at all besides stating that the language is in Java. Nobody will care if what you need help with is your homework or just a thing you do for fun, it's much more useful to say what your problem is about in your subject/title. As for the question itself, Jon does a good job of explaining what the objective of the code is, and providing his own code. However, since he does not have any specific questions or examples, he is essentially asking people to finish his assignment for him. People even replied to him, asking him to be more specific about his problem.

Hopefully these examples have shown that question-asking really is a skill, and a very useful one. We saw from the second example that even though it did do a couple of things correctly, it still essentially only asked for their code to be done for them. If you can't properly ask a question, how can you expect some stranger on the internet to properly answer you? Asking poor questions will likely give you a poor answer, or maybe even no answer at all. Therefore, it is in our best interest to ask questions smarter.
